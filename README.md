# Maize_Bee_transcriptomics
Public repo for the exploration of transcriptomic analyses post DGE list generation of Maize and Bee.

This work was the result of collaborative efforts from the [2021_workshop_transcriptomics](https://github.com/ISUgenomics/2021_workshop_transcriptomics) repo

Work-in progress! *Much work, many edits, WOW, so Internet*

Ultimate goal: Condense data, scripts, etc. to easy-to-follow step-by-step analysis of maize and bee RNAseq data
